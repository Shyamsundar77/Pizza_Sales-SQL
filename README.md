# Pizza_Sales-SQL

In this project I have analyzed pizza sales data using SQL queries to extract key insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and revenue trends. Through effective database querying, the project addresses specific business questions, offering a comprehensive view of the pizza sales operation.

## Key Questions Addressed
The project answers the following 13 key questions:

1. What is the **total number of orders** placed?
2. How much **total revenue** has been generated from pizza sales?
3. Which is the **highest-priced pizza** on the menu?
4. What is the **most common pizza size** ordered?
5. Which are the **top 5 most ordered pizza types** and their respective quantities?
6. How many pizzas were ordered in total for each **pizza category**?
7. What is the **distribution of orders by hour** of the day?
8. What is the **category-wise distribution** of pizzas?
9. What is the **average number of pizzas** ordered per day?
10. Which are the **top 3 most ordered pizza types by revenue**?
11. What is the **percentage contribution of each pizza type** to total revenue?
12. How does the **cumulative revenue** grow over time?
13. Which are the **top 3 most ordered pizza types by revenue** in each category?


## Project Description
The pizza sales database comprises several key tables:
- **Order_details**: Contains detailed information on each pizza order.
- **Orders**: Includes customer order information, such as order time and customer ID.
- **Pizza_types**: Describes different types of pizzas available on the menu.
- **Pizzas**: Contains the attributes of individual pizzas including size and price.

### Analysis and Insights
The SQL queries in this project deliver the following insights:
- Total number of orders placed and overall revenue, providing a financial overview of the business.
- Insights into customer preferences, including the most common pizza size and the highest-priced pizza.
- Identification of the top 5 most ordered pizzas, aiding in marketing and inventory management.
- Analysis of sales trends, including order distribution by hour and by date, to identify peak sales periods.
- Category-wise distribution of pizzas and total quantities ordered.
- Revenue insights showing the percentage contribution of each pizza type and the top 3 revenue-generating pizza types.


## Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales using structured SQL queries, offering deep insights into various aspects of the business. By calculating the total number of orders and overall revenue, a clear view of the business's financial health was established, helping to assess sales strategies. The analysis also highlighted customer preferences, such as the most popular pizza sizes and highest-priced pizzas, which can optimize menu offerings and marketing. Identifying the top 5 most ordered pizzas revealed critical insights into sales drivers, aiding inventory management and promotional efforts. Further, sales trends by hour and date were pinpointed, essential for managing staffing and supply chains. The project also analyzed revenue breakdowns, identifying the top revenue-generating pizzas and key contributors to overall sales, which can help refine pricing strategies. Overall, the analysis provided actionable data for strategic decision-making, including product refinement, customer targeting, and operational improvements. This project demonstrated the power of SQL in deriving insights from raw data, enabling the business to stay competitive and meet customer demands. These findings can guide ongoing sales analysis and support business growth, contributing to more informed, data-driven decisions. Thank you for exploring this project, and we hope it assists in boosting both sales and customer satisfaction.
